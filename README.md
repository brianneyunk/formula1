Formula 1 - Data Viz Practice

Datasets pulled from Kaggle on 6/7/22 - uploaded by user Vopani, updated 2 months ago.

Using sheets, I used the SUMIFS function to add all points by team by year and then excluded teams that had zero points for the entire period. Then I inserted the first chart - initially with X- and Y- axis flipped - and edited to got to the attached. 

With McLaren's current middling success, I was surprised when pulling data at how well they had done in the early 2000s. Thus, I next wanted to look at the percentage of constructor's championships per team over the same time period. This is illustrated in the pie chart. I used the MAX function on the data I had already collected for the above analysis and then VLOOKUP to find which team name had the max points (and therefore won the constructor's championship that year). Finally, I inserted the pie chart and updated colors to match current team colors.
